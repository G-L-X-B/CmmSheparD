# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### `$ whoami`

My name is Gleb Ustinov, and I am just yet another CS student on the verge of dropout. As a beginning software engineer I am interested in applying my skills to development of useful tools and preventing machine uprising in the process. Here you will find projects that I'm most proud of, aside from some sketches and drafts.

### `$ git clone git@github.com:CmmSheparD/most-interesting.git`

A simple game that plays itself written in **C** with the help of **ncurses**. It's a mess rn, but some day I will tidy it up. What I like in the concept of procedural programming is that it allows to build neat and well-knit little programs, where every module was written for a particular purpose. Low code reusability hits hard though, and I doubt my competence to create something large-scale using this paradigm. But this little thing... I love it.

***More interesting things are coming soon***

### `$ git checkout learning`

With my first language being **C++**, I like low-level programming, but still never miss a chance to try out something different. Here comes my subtle acquaintance with **python**. Currently I'm learning **Kotlin/JVM** and, as a consequence, **Java** ~~omg i hate **gradle** so much why is it so messed up~~ well it's actually good once you put at least some effort into learning it.

### `$ git blame`

I'm really bad at visual design or even deciding which of two designs would fit better. But I'm not going to give up and will continue work on this! Completely not interested in front-end development though.
